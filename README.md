# Melbourne Temperature Forecast Using Neural Networks

## Overview
This project focuses on forecasting daily minimum temperatures in Melbourne using Dense Neural Networks (DNN) and Simple Recurrent Neural Networks (SimpleRNN). It's part of practical applications of neural networks in time series analysis.

## Features
- **Data Source**: Historical data from Kaggle on Melbourne's daily minimum temperatures.
- **Models Used**: 
  - Dense Neural Network (DNN)
  - Simple Recurrent Neural Network (SimpleRNN)
- **Evaluation**: Models are evaluated and compared using RÂ² score and visual analysis.

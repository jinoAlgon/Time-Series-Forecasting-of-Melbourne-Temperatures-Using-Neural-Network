# Melbourne Temperature Forecast Using Neural Networks

## Overview
This project focuses on forecasting daily minimum temperatures in Melbourne using Dense Neural Networks (DNN) and Simple Recurrent Neural Networks (SimpleRNN). It's part of CST8506 coursework and demonstrates practical applications of neural networks in time series analysis.

## Features
- **Data Source**: Historical data from Kaggle on Melbourne's daily minimum temperatures.
- **Models Used**: 
  - Dense Neural Network (DNN)
  - Simple Recurrent Neural Network (SimpleRNN)
- **Evaluation**: Models are evaluated and compared using RÂ² score and visual analysis.

## Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Repository Contents
- Jupyter Notebooks with complete code for analysis, model building, and evaluation.
- Visualizations comparing model predictions with actual data.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Explore the Jupyter Notebooks to understand the data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation process.

## Future Work
Further exploration with advanced RNN architectures like LSTM and GRU, and hyperparameter tuning for improved model performance.
